.SH NAME
sisupdate - IBM storage adapter/disk unit microcode/configuration update utility
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B sisupdate
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B sisupdate
is used to update the firmware on IBM storage adapters and the disk units
attached to them and to update the configuration to use the saved configuration. 
It can be run at any time while the ibmsis device driver is loaded. The 
utility will check the firmware revision level of each storage adapter/disk unit on
the system and compare it to the firmware revision level that is installed
in /etc/microcode. If the firmware levels do not 
match, the firmware will be updated. Only adapters/disk units needing an update
will be updated. Additionally, this utility will configure SCSI bus attributes 
such as maximum bus speed, initiator SCSI ID, etc. This utility MUST be run in order
to enable bus speeds > 80 MB/s. It is desired that this be called in early boot 
shortly after the ibmsis device driver is loaded.

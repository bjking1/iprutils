This directory contains user space tools required by the ipr device driver.
To install them, type 'make' and then 'make install'.  You will need pciutils-devel,
ncurses, ncurses-devel, and sysfsutils packages installed to perform the 'make'.  

iprdump - A user program meant to be run in the background to gather debug
information should an IOA failure occur.  Ideally, this program should be
started during boot time after file systems are loaded when the ipr
SCSI driver is used.

iprupdate - IOA/disk unit microcode update utility
This tool requires no arguments and should be run after each time the device driver
is loaded. It will query each adapter/disk unit for the microcode version and update 
adapters/disk units that are not currently at the minimum supported levels. 

iprconfig - IOA Configuration and Recovery tool
This is an ncurses based utility used to configure ipr adapters and devices.
The basic functions of this tool are:

CONFIGURATION
1. Display disk hardware status.  This can be used to display all SCSI disks attached
to your system. Using this option it is possible to obtain the physical location
of each device on the system.
2. Work with SCSI Bus Configuration.  This allows flexibility in setting some
SCSI Bus parameters such is Max Bus Throughput and host SCSI ID.
3. Work with Driver Configuration.  Currently allows adjustment to the devices drivers
log level.

RAID
4. Delete a disk array. Allows you to delete existing arrays.  Data stored
on the devices will not be preserved after issuing this command.
5. Create a disk array.  Used to create a disk array.
6. Add a device to a disk array.  This option allows devices of similar capacity
to be included into an existing disk array.
7. Configure a hot spare device.  Configure a disk to become a hot spare, capable
of being used by the adapter to automatically replace a failed device
8. Format Device for advanced function/Format Device for JBOD (Just a Bunch Of DASD) function.
Disk devices can either be formatted to 512 bytes/sector or 522 bytes/sector. Devices must
be formatted to 522 bytes/sector, or advanced function format, in order to be used in
a disk array or as a hot spare. Devices not in a disk array can be formatted to
512 bytes/sector so they can be used directly by the operating system.


RECOVERY
9. Rebuild disk unit data.  This option is generally used following concurrent
maintenance.  Select this option after a failing array member device has been replaced to
reconstruct device as an active array member.
10. Device concurrent maintenance. This can be used to concurrently add or replace disk
units from a running system.
11. Reclaim IOA cache storage. This is to be used by IBM hardware service personnel only. 
Use of this function is potentially dangerous and may delete data from the non-volatile
write cache on the adapter.
12. Initialize and format disk unit. This allows you to issue an actual SCSI format command 
to SCSI disks. Proceed with caution when using this option.
13. Work with Resources Containing Cache Battery Packs.  A set of displays are used to view
the current status of the Cache Battery on resources containing battery packs and allow
maintanence actions to be performed against those resources when necessary.
14. Analyze Log. This allows you to view the error messages logged by the ipr device driver.
